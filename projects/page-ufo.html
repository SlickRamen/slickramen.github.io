            Spaceships litter the skies. Alien forces have come to eradicate human life. Who will stand against them? 
            Who will answer the call to action? ULTRA FORCE has been called in. And even if the chances of victory are slim, they aren't going down without a fight.

            This endless, point-hoarding, vertical shooter created for the OperaGX Jam 2021, where the game had to be kept beneath 5 megabytes and have multiplayer & highscore functionality.
            I worked on it with some friends from the content hosting site Newgrounds. The constraints made us think in interesting ways and act more cautiously. One of the highlights
            for me was the upgrade system, where the player can pick from a pool of augments that change things such as how the weapons act and feel. This is the second(ish) installment in
            my "shoot-em-up" game catalogue (which I may expand in the future).
