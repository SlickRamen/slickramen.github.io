            This game was made in roughly 3 hours for a game jam. I wanted to make a wave based fighting game and make it super juiced up. The gameplay is super basic and the game is fairly short. 
            I thought that this was fitting considering the tight time contraints the game was made under. In the end, I was extremely happy with how all of the gameplay systems came together in such a short period of time,
            and how juicy the game felt.
