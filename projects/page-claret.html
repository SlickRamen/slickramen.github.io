            It's a race to the exit where every millisecond matters. Escape perilous traps and evade obstacles, 
            with the biggest being yourself. Your own blood leaks from your squishy body, 
            splattering onto whatever you smash into. It burns you - stay in it for too long and you'll be blown to smithereens.

        <span class="page-body">
            I started working on Claret in 2021 as a side project. I'd just joined the popular content hosting site Newgrounds and wanted to experiment with a quick and easy project.
            I built the game around the fast-paced platforming aspect and the blood mechanic allowed me to create some pretty interesting puzzle designs. I wanted to go with very simple graphics
            and focus more on making the experience feel juicy and the movement feel weighty yet precise.
            <br><br>
            This game was the beginning of my experiments with movement platformer games and another entry on my ever-growing list of puzzle games.
