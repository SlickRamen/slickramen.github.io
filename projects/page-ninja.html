            I made this game for a highschool assignment. We were tasked with creating a game using the PyGame framework for Python. I'd never used it before but picked it up pretty quickly.
            I really wanted to push myself with this project to see what I could do using an unfamiliar framework and in a short period of time. I was inspired heavily by the game "Samurai Gunn"
            and I believe the influence shines through.
            <br><br>
            I started by creating a basic movement system and camera, allowing me to work on the platforming elements and make them feel really good.
            I then began working on the traps and enemy AI. I knew as this was for a school assessment, I needed to create a somewhat convincing enemy AI character so that it could be assessed properly.
            My goal from the start was to allow for couch co-op (I implemented 4 playable characters but due to most keyboards not supporting that many keyboard inputs it wasn't very playable).
            <br><br>
            I then spent a fair bit of time designing the assets and animations. I had to make a lot of custom classes to allow for animated characters and particle effects. I knew I wanted to include these
            as I thought they'd improve the overall experience tenfold. I was proven right as in the end I was extremely proud of the way the graphics looked and how juicy the gameplay experience was.
            <br><br>
            I also implemented a level save and load feature and tutorial. To make it easier to create these levels, I also created a level editor system to allow me to precisely place props in the level, define spawn locations
            and create traps and pitfalls.
