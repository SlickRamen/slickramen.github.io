            Cable Boy puts you in the electric boots of a cable head guy trying to find his girlfriend. 
            You'll have to be a skilled platformerer to make it through this small LIGHTNING fast game (that was made in 48 hours!)

            This was made in 48 hours for the Gamemaker's Toolkit game jam. Yet another puzzle game, although I really liked the mechanics that were on offer and the overall concept felt super unique and fresh.
            Unfortunately due to the 48 hour limit, we didn't have much time to explore the puzzle aspects deeper.
