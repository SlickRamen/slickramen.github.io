        <span class="page-header">Development</span>
        <span class="page-body">
            The application concluded development in September of 2025. It was developed by a small group of University students for the course SENG302. 
            It is programmed in Java and uses Spring Boot and Thymeleaf for the backend and frontend respectively.
            It was developed using a Scrum development framework, with a total of 6 3-week sprints taking place. The first 3 sprints featured user stories
            devised by the Product Owner, and the remainder of the sprints focused on stories from the team's own product vision.
