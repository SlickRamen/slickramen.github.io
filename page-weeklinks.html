            Planning and managing a flat can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to dividing out chores, expenses, and other responsibilities. 
            Weeklinks is a web application that aims to simplify this process by providing a user-friendly interface for managing flat-related tasks.
            It allows you to manage flat jobs, expenses and routines, and promote better communication amongst flatmates. 
            It aims to help with all of the heavy lifting behind-the-scenes to help keep your flat running smoothly.

            Some planned features include:
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>Calendar for scheduling events</li>
                <li>Combined shopping lists</li>
                <li>Managing payments for rent, power, water and shopping</li>
                <li>Flat chats and polls for a seamless in-app experience</li>
                <li>Schedule / routine manager to keep track of chores and weekly meals</li>
                <li>Flat notice board to keep track of important information</li>
            </ul>

            I am currently in the early stages of developing this application with my brother as a means to help manage my
            own flat. After living in a flat for the past 3 years, I have found that keeping ontop of tasks and chores can
            be difficult, especially when all of the information isn't compiled in one place. By creating this application,
            I hope to be able to help myself and others manage their flats more effectively, by combining important
            flat information into one place, such as combined cards, expenses such as rent and power, shopping lists and
            chores. By creating an app designed to do some of the heavy lifting in terms of organization in the background,
            I hope to be able to lead a more organized and stress-free life in my flat.
            <br><br>
            The application is very early days, and is currently being developed in Java and Spring Boot. It was initially
            devised as a joint shopping list application, however necessity bred innovation and its purpose has since evolved
            to better suit my current needs.
