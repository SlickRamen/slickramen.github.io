            Mysteriously thrust back in time, you awake in a desolate landscape, not knowing were, or when you are. You are a nobody, to the extent that you don't even know who you truly are. 
            Dazed, Confused and looking for answers, you must scour the strange lands that you now inhabit for any hopes of getting back to whatever life you had previously. 
            You know that where you reside currently is not familiar, but you have no memory of your past life.

            This game was another one of my earlier game jam games, however it was the biggest project that I'd attempted and successfully finished at the time. I finished it in under a week and was very happy with the result.
            I was inspired by early turnbased action RPGs, and the timeframe of the jam allowed me to attempt something larger than I usually would. A lot of the gameplay systems were unfamiliar to me at the time
            and I was figuring it out as I went, but I think the game turned out pretty cool in the end.
