            Welcome to Grape Expectations, a desktop application which aims to eliminate the uncertainty and confusion by providing an organised and cohesive guide to the
            complex world of wine tasting. This application will enable you to explore wine data, take notes, rate wines, and keep track of your favourites.

        <span class="page-body">
            This application was developed in a small group as a University project. It was a great opportunity to work with a team and learn about the software development process. 
            We used Java and JavaFX to create the application, and we focused on creating a user-friendly interface. The project was a success and we received positive feedback from our peers and instructors.
            The app was designed to be run on Linux, however it was also functional on Windows and MacOS.
