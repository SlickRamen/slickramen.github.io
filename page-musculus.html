            The game is puzzle platformer where you control mice and rats through logistic problems, 
            where every time you restart the level, the previous rat continues along its path remembering what you did last time - with several bumps along the way.

        <span class="page-body">
            This game was made in 3 days for a pretty big game jam, where it placed 15th overall out of rougly 1000 submissions (it placed 4th overall for fun!). It is by far one of my favourite
            game concepts I've ever finished, and I worked with one of my longstanding game-dev buddies Stepford on it. The premise seemed to form itself during development, and the concept of
            controlling multiple batches of "lab rats" was fitting thematically and also resulted in some really fun puzzle elements.
