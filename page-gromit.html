            I am currently developing this application as a means to assist my web development ventures. Because of my recent interest in web apps, and the increasing demand (from myself)
            for an easy-to-use iconfont generator has become more and more apparent, as icons serve as a great visual aid to users on any website.
            Currently in very early stages, however it is functional and is currently being used (by me) in a handful of applications and websites (such as this one!).
            It is built with React and a Node backend.
