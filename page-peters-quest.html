           Leading off from just after the events of the first game, Pico and his pals are thrust into the heart of the realm Peter
           and his underlings reside in. As they journey further and further into his domain, his hold over them tightens.
           Play as Pico on his Quest to slay every last ant in existence to save all of mankind.

        <span class="page-body">
            I started working on Peter's Quest in 2021, inteded for a late 2021 release. I made it for one of the events on the content hosting site Newgrounds but didn't finish it in time, 
            so I put some more effort into polishing it up and released it the next year. I was really into turnbased roguelike RPGs (namely Darkest Dungeon) at the time and wanted to make something similar.
            The game was extremely well received and was featured on the "Legendary Games" section of Newgrounds for a while.
            <br><br>
            As with all of my projects, I really tried to push myself to create something I could be 100% proud of. I put a lot of time and effort into the art, animation and gameplay design / systems to ensure
            everything worked together seamlessly. Due to the positive receiption of the game, I have started working on a sequel.
